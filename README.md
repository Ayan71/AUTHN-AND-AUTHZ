# AUTHN-AND-AUTHZ

Project Name:AUTHN-AND-AUTHZ "Node.js Authentication Middleware".

Description: The user makes a request to the web application, targeting a specific route or endpoint.
Before the request reaches the corresponding controller/action, the middleware intercepts it.
Inside the middleware, you would typically check if the user is authenticated. This could involve validating their credentials, checking session data, or verifying tokens, depending on the authentication mechanism you're using.
If the user is authenticated, the middleware allows the request to proceed to the intended controller/action. If not, it may redirect the user to a login page or return an error response.
After the middleware has completed its checks, the request reaches the controller/action, which performs the necessary processing based on the specific functionality of that endpoint.
The controller/action returns a response to the user, completing the request-response cycle.
